# Retail-Super-Store-Data-Analysis
This the third assignment under GRIP of The Sparks Foundation, Batch of April 2024. The sample superstore retail dataset is given. 
The objective of the task is to :
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Super Store dataset.
2. As a business manager try to find out weak areas where you can work to increase profit.
3. Find out all business problems you can derive from the given dataset.

Following are the important insights from EDA:
- Assuming the data belongs to same time frame for all products. The superstore sells 17 products under 3 categories. If we analyse the sales, profit and quantity of products sold by the categories we can see that:
- Furniture category is making least profit among the three and the quantity sold is greater than technology category. Hence, the store management needs to focus on this category. 
- **Tables and Bookcases** have generated significant **loss** to the store. Hence, management needs to focus on these two products. Further data will be required to understand why the loss?
- **Copiers is the star product of the store**. The quantity sold is least among all other products, the dicount offered is the least among all the products, but the profit is highest. Copiers seems to be the most popular product.
- Phones were sold in huge quantity and has generated second highest profit. Accessories have also generated significant profit. 
- Copiers, Phones, and Accessories are the top 3 profitable products. 
- Binders, papers and furnishings are top 3 best selling products. 
- Art,Enevlops and labels have not incurred any loss and totally profit making products.
- Chairs have also generated significant sales thereby being profitable. 
- Consumer is the profitable customer segment.
- Store management can increase their sales at western and central region. 
- Profits earned are highest western part of the US. The store must increase their sales in this region.
- California state have highest sales, maximum profit and highest quantity sold with minimum discounts. The store must boost their spread in top 10 states by reaching all the cities.

The business problems that can be derived from data are:
- How does the sales, profit, discount and quantity sold varies region-wise, state-wise and segment-wise, category-wise?
- Which are the top 3 best selling products?
- Which are the top 3 profit making products?
- Which type of mode is suitable for more profit?
- Which country has the highest profit?
- Which region has the highest sales and profit?
- Does discount offered show impact on sales and profit?

The weak areas which management needs to focus on in order increase profit:
1. Tables, Bookcases, supplies are weak performing products. Machines need speacial attension as it is generating higher losses despite being profitable. 
2. Central region is causing higher looses hence needs special attension.
3. Management must do further analysis on bottom 10 states which have generated lower profits. 
4. Standard class shipping mode is most profitable and have also incurred maximum losses hence the losses are need to be optimized in order to increase overall profits.
